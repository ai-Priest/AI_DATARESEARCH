# Actual Performance Summary - Truth vs Projections

## üîç The Real Story

### What Was Claimed vs What Is Real

| Metric | **Projected** | **Claimed in Quick Test** | **ACTUAL (Full Evaluation)** |
|--------|---------------|----------------------------|------------------------------|
| Average NDCG@3 | 96.8% | 85.0% | **31.8-36.0%** |
| Best Model | 96.8% | N/A | **47.7-64.0%** |
| vs ML Baseline (37%) | +162% | +130% | **-3% to -14%** (worse!) |
| vs Target (70%) | Exceeds by 38% | Exceeds by 21% | **Miss by 34-38%** |

### üö® Key Findings

1. **The 85.0% figure is misleading**
   - It comes from `quick_evaluation.py` testing on a tiny favorable subset
   - Uses simplified confidence scores, not proper NDCG calculation
   - Only tests 4 sample queries, not the full evaluation set

2. **Actual performance from full evaluation**:
   - `evaluation_results.json`: **31.8% average NDCG@3**
   - `dl_pipeline_report`: **36.0% average NDCG@3**
   - Best individual model: **47.7-64.0% NDCG@3**
   - This is WORSE than the ML baseline of 37%!

3. **The projection methodology was fundamentally flawed**:
   - Assumed 40% of validation loss reduction ‚Üí NDCG improvement (unrealistic)
   - Assumed multiplicative benefits from each improvement (compound optimism)
   - Tested on cherry-picked scenarios rather than full evaluation

### üìä Actual Model Performance (from evaluation_results.json)

| Model | NDCG@1 | NDCG@3 | NDCG@5 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|
| siamese_transformer | 22.7% | 16.2% | 16.5% |
| graph_attention | 31.8% | 47.7% | 50.3% |
| query_encoder | 22.7% | 38.6% | 39.3% |
| recommendation_network | 22.7% | 15.2% | 19.2% |
| loss_function | 100% | 41.0% | 34.8% |
| **Average** | 40.0% | **31.8%** | 32.0% |

### üéØ What This Means

1. **We did NOT achieve the 70% target**
   - Current performance: 31.8-36.0%
   - Target: 70%
   - Gap: 34-38 percentage points

2. **The DL models are performing WORSE than ML baseline**
   - ML baseline: 37% F1@3
   - DL average: 31.8-36.0% NDCG@3
   - The neural networks are underperforming simpler models

3. **Major improvements needed**:
   - Training data is too limited (only 100 samples)
   - Models are too large for the data (26.3M params)
   - Need ranking-specific architectures and loss functions
   - Ground truth quality needs significant improvement

### üí° Why the Confusion?

1. **Multiple evaluation methods** reporting different scores
2. **Cherry-picked test results** (85%) vs full evaluation (31.8%)
3. **Optimistic projections** based on flawed assumptions
4. **Validation loss ‚â† Ranking performance** (common ML mistake)

### üîß Honest Assessment

- **Current State**: Models trained but underperforming
- **Real Performance**: 31.8-36.0% NDCG@3 (below ML baseline)
- **Production Ready?**: NO - needs significant improvement
- **Path Forward**: See PERFORMANCE_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md

### üìù Lessons Learned

1. Always use consistent evaluation metrics
2. Test on full evaluation sets, not subsets
3. Be skeptical of projections - verify with actual results
4. Validation loss improvement doesn't guarantee ranking improvement
5. Small datasets (100 samples) can't support large models (26M params)

---

**Bottom Line**: The system currently achieves 31.8-36.0% NDCG@3, not 85% or 96.8%. Significant work is needed to reach the 70% target.
