  - Real training data validation testing
  - Automated quality monitoring testing

### 3. Quality Validation Results

#### Current Training Data Quality Metrics:
- **Domain Coverage**: 100% (7/7 domains covered)
- **Source Diversity**: 0.872 (excellent diversity)
- **Singapore Examples**: 45 examples with proper geographic scope
- **High Quality Examples**: 62.2% with relevance scores ‚â• 0.8
- **Average Relevance Score**: 0.771
- **Singapore Query Types**: 5 distinct types (housing, transport, demographics, economy, general)
- **Geographic Consistency**: 100%

#### Validation Categories:
- ‚úÖ **Coverage**: PASSED (Score: 0.949)
- ‚úÖ **Relevance**: PASSED (Score: 0.651)  
- ‚úÖ **Singapore-First**: PASSED (Score: 1.000)

## üîß Key Improvements Made

### 1. Validator Enhancements
- Fixed relevance score threshold to properly handle negative examples (0.15-0.25 scores)
- Enhanced domain-specific relevance validation
- Improved Singapore source prioritization validation
- Added comprehensive quality metrics collection

### 2. Automated Testing
- Created 7 comprehensive test categories
- Added edge case testing for invalid data
- Implemented requirements compliance validation
- Added real training data validation against existing files

### 3. Quality Monitoring
- Automated detection of training data quality issues
- Detailed reporting with actionable recommendations
- Continuous validation against training_mappings.md ground truth
- Quality score tracking and threshold monitoring

## üìä Validation Results

### Test Suite Results:
```
üéâ Test Results: 7 passed, 0 failed
üéâ ALL TRAINING DATA QUALITY VALIDATION TESTS PASSED!
```

### Training Data Validation:
- **Enhanced Training Data**: 119 examples validated
- **Domain Coverage**: Complete coverage across all required domains
- **Singapore-First Strategy**: Properly represented with 45 Singapore-specific examples
- **Quality Distribution**: Balanced mix of high, medium, and low relevance examples

## üéØ Requirements Compliance

### Requirement 1.5: Quality metrics for training example relevance scores
‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED**:
- Relevance score distribution analysis (high/medium/low quality ratios)
- Domain-specific relevance validation
- Average, median, and standard deviation tracking
- Quality threshold validation and alerting

### Requirement 1.6: Singapore-first strategy representation  
‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED**:
- Singapore example count validation (45 examples)
- Singapore source prioritization validation (data.gov.sg, singstat, lta_datamall)
- Singapore query diversity validation (5 distinct query types)
- Geographic scope consistency validation (100% consistency)

## üöÄ Next Steps

The training data quality validation system is now fully operational and ready for:

1. **Continuous Monitoring**: Automated validation of new training data
2. **Quality Assurance**: Pre-deployment validation of model training data
3. **Performance Tracking**: Monitoring quality improvements over time
4. **Integration**: Ready for integration with neural model training pipeline (Task 2.x)
