# Quality Improvements Examples

## Overview

This document showcases real examples of how the quality-first enhancements have improved the AI-Powered Dataset Research Assistant's recommendations. Each example compares the old system's results with the new enhanced system's results.

## Example 1: Singapore Housing Research

### Query: "singapore housing prices"

#### Before Enhancement (Old System)
```json
{
  "query": "singapore housing prices",
  "results": [
    {
      "rank": 1,
      "source": "kaggle",
      "title": "House Prices Dataset",
      "relevance_score": 0.45,
      "explanation": "Generic housing price dataset"
    },
    {
      "rank": 2,
      "source": "world_bank",
      "title": "Global Housing Indicators",
      "relevance_score": 0.38,
      "explanation": "International housing statistics"
    },
    {
      "rank": 3,
      "source": "github",
      "title": "Real Estate Analysis Code",
      "relevance_score": 0.32,
      "explanation": "Code repository for housing analysis"
    }
  ],
  "overall_quality": 0.38,
  "singapore_specific": false
}
```

**Issues with Old System:**
- ❌ No Singapore-specific sources prioritized
- ❌ Generic global datasets instead of local data
- ❌ Low relevance scores (all below 0.5)
- ❌ Code repositories mixed with data sources
- ❌ No understanding of geographic context

#### After Enhancement (New System)
```json
{
  "query": "singapore housing prices",
  "results": [
    {
      "rank": 1,
      "source": "data_gov_sg",
      "title": "HDB Resale Flat Prices",
      "relevance_score": 0.94,
      "quality_score": 0.96,
      "explanation": "Official Singapore government housing data - comprehensive HDB transaction records from 1990 onwards",
      "routing_reason": "Singapore-first priority for local housing data",
      "last_updated": "2024-01-15",
      "update_frequency": "Monthly"
    },
    {
      "rank": 2,
      "source": "singstat",
      "title": "Private Residential Property Price Index",
      "relevance_score": 0.89,
      "quality_score": 0.94,
      "explanation": "Official statistics for private housing market trends and price indices",
      "routing_reason": "Singapore Department of Statistics - authoritative local data",
      "last_updated": "2024-01-10",
      "update_frequency": "Quarterly"
    },
    {
      "rank": 3,
      "source": "data_gov_sg",
      "title": "Private Residential Property Transactions",
      "relevance_score": 0.87,
      "quality_score": 0.92,
      "explanation": "Detailed private property transaction data including prices, locations, and property types",
      "routing_reason": "Comprehensive Singapore private housing market data",
      "last_updated": "2024-01-12",
      "update_frequency": "Monthly"
    }
  ],
  "quality_summary": {
    "overall_ndcg_at_3": 0.91,
    "singapore_first_applied": true,
    "domain_classification": "singapore",
    "confidence": 0.95
  }
}
```

**Improvements with New System:**
