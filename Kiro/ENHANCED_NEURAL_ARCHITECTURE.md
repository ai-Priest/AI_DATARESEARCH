# Enhanced Neural Architecture Documentation

## Overview

The Quality-First Neural Model represents a significant architectural improvement over the baseline system, prioritizing recommendation relevance and accuracy over raw inference speed. This document details the enhanced architecture, training procedures, and quality optimization strategies.

## Architecture Components

### 1. QualityAwareRankingModel

The core neural model implements a lightweight yet effective architecture optimized for dataset recommendation quality:

**Key Features:**
- **Reduced Parameter Count**: ~5M parameters (down from 26.3M) while maintaining accuracy
- **Quality-First Design**: Optimized for NDCG@3 and relevance accuracy over speed
- **Domain-Specific Routing**: Specialized heads for Singapore-first and domain classification
- **Cross-Attention Mechanism**: Enhanced query-source matching capabilities

**Architecture Details:**
```python
# Model Dimensions
embedding_dim: 256      # Reduced from 512 for efficiency
hidden_dim: 128         # Reduced from 256 for efficiency
num_domains: 8          # psychology, climate, singapore, etc.
num_sources: 10         # kaggle, zenodo, world_bank, etc.
vocab_size: 10000       # Query tokenization vocabulary

# Core Components
- Query Encoder: 2-layer Transformer with 8 attention heads
- Cross-Attention: 4-head attention for query-source matching
- Ranking Head: 3-layer MLP with batch normalization and dropout
- Singapore Classifier: Binary classification for local vs global queries
- Domain Classifier: Multi-class classification for specialized routing
```

### 2. Enhanced Training Data Integration

The model leverages manually curated training mappings from `training_mappings.md`:

**Training Data Features:**
- **Manual Feedback Integration**: Direct incorporation of expert-curated query-source mappings
- **Relevance Scoring**: Explicit relevance scores (0.0-1.0) for each query-source pair
- **Domain Classification**: Automatic categorization into psychology, climate, Singapore, etc.
- **Singapore-First Strategy**: Prioritization logic for local government sources
- **Hard Negative Sampling**: Improved ranking discrimination through negative examples

**Data Augmentation:**
```python
# Synthetic Example Generation
- Query paraphrasing for domain-specific queries
- Synonym replacement for geographic terms
- Hard negative mining from low-relevance mappings
- Cross-domain negative examples for better discrimination
```

### 3. Quality-First Loss Function

The training objective prioritizes multiple quality aspects:

```python
# Loss Components
total_loss = (
    0.6 * ranking_loss +      # Primary: relevance ranking (MSE)
    0.2 * singapore_loss +    # Singapore-first classification
    0.2 * domain_loss         # Domain-specific routing
)

# Ranking-Specific Losses (Alternative Options)
- ListMLE: Listwise ranking optimization
- RankNet: Pairwise ranking comparisons  
- LambdaRank: Direct NDCG@3 optimization
```

## Training Procedures

### 1. Quality-Aware Training Pipeline

**Training Configuration:**
```yaml
# Model Training
batch_size: 32
learning_rate: 0.001
optimizer: AdamW
scheduler: CosineAnnealingLR
max_epochs: 100
early_stopping: NDCG@3 validation (patience=10)

# Quality Optimization
curriculum_learning: true    # Start with high-confidence mappings
quality_threshold: 0.7      # Minimum acceptable NDCG@3
validation_metric: NDCG@3   # Primary validation metric
```

**Training Phases:**
1. **Phase 1**: High-confidence mappings (relevance_score >= 0.8)
2. **Phase 2**: Medium-confidence mappings (0.5 <= relevance_score < 0.8)
3. **Phase 3**: All mappings with hard negative sampling
4. **Phase 4**: Fine-tuning with domain-specific objectives

### 2. Enhanced Data Processing

**Training Data Pipeline:**
```python
# Data Sources
1. training_mappings.md (manual expert mappings)
2. Synthetic augmentation (query paraphrasing)
3. Hard negative mining (low-relevance sources)
4. Domain-specific splits (psychology, climate, etc.)

# Quality Validation
- Coverage analysis across domains
- Relevance score distribution validation
- Singapore-first strategy representation
- Negative example quality assessment
```

### 3. Model Optimization Techniques

**Memory and Speed Optimizations:**
- **Mixed Precision Training**: FP16 for reduced memory usage
- **Gradient Checkpointing**: Memory-efficient backpropagation
- **Model Quantization**: Post-training quantization for inference
- **Batch Processing**: Efficient batching for similar queries

## Quality Validation Framework

### 1. Training Mappings Compliance

The model is continuously validated against the expert-curated training mappings:

```python
# Validation Metrics

- Relevance Accuracy: Agreement with training mapping scores
- Domain Routing Accuracy: Correct domain classification rate
- Singapore-First Accuracy: Correct local vs global routing
```

### 2. Quality Monitoring

**Real-time Quality Tracking:**
```python
# Quality Metrics Collection
class QualityMonitoringSystem:
    def track_recommendation_quality(self):
        - Monitor NDCG@3 against training mappings
        - Track domain routing accuracy
        - Measure Singapore-first effectiveness
        - Alert on quality degradation below 0.65 threshold
```

### 3. Continuous Improvement

**Feedback Integration:**
- User feedback collection and integration
- Training mapping updates and retraining
- A/B testing for quality improvements
- Performance regression testing

## API Integration

### 1. Enhanced Query Router

The neural model integrates with the Enhanced Query Router for intelligent routing:

```python
# Router Integration
class EnhancedQueryRouter:
    def classify_query(self, query: str) -> QueryClassification:
        # Use neural model for domain classification
        domain, singapore_first = self.model.predict_domain_and_singapore(query)
        
        # Apply rule-based validation
        confidence = self._validate_neural_prediction(domain, singapore_first)
        
        return QueryClassification(
            domain=domain,
            singapore_first_applicable=singapore_first,
            confidence=confidence,
            recommended_sources=self._get_recommended_sources(domain, singapore_first)
        )
```

### 2. Quality-Aware Caching

The model works with the quality-aware caching system:

```python
# Cache Integration
class QualityAwareCacheManager:
    def cache_recommendations(self, query: str, recommendations: List):
        # Calculate quality metrics using neural model
        quality_metrics = self._calculate_quality_metrics(query, recommendations)
        
        # Only cache high-quality results
        if quality_metrics.meets_quality_threshold(0.7):
            ttl = self._calculate_quality_based_ttl(quality_metrics)
            self._store_with_quality_validation(query, recommendations, ttl)
```

- User complaints about irrelevant results

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check training mapping compliance
python -m src.dl.quality_first_neural_model --validate-mappings

# Analyze quality metrics
python -m src.ai.quality_monitoring_system --generate-report
```

**Solutions:**
1. **Update Training Mappings**: Add more expert-curated examples
2. **Retrain Model**: Use updated mappings with curriculum learning
3. **Adjust Quality Threshold**: Temporarily lower threshold while improving
4. **Check Data Quality**: Validate training data coverage and balance

#### 2. Singapore-First Strategy Not Working

**Symptoms:**
- Local queries returning global sources first
- Singapore government sources ranked too low
- Geographic routing accuracy below 85%

**Diagnosis:**
```python
# Test Singapore-first classification
from src.ai.enhanced_query_router import EnhancedQueryRouter
router = EnhancedQueryRouter()

test_queries = [
    "singapore housing prices",
    "local transport data",
    "sg population statistics"
]

for query in test_queries:
    classification = router.classify_query(query)
    print(f"Query: {query}")
    print(f"Singapore-first: {classification.singapore_first_applicable}")
    print(f"Sources: {classification.recommended_sources[:3]}")
```

**Solutions:**
1. **Update Singapore Keywords**: Add more local terms to detection

    ("psychology research data", "psychology", ["kaggle", "zenodo"]),
    ("climate change datasets", "climate", ["world_bank", "zenodo"]),
    ("machine learning competitions", "machine_learning", ["kaggle"])
]

for query, expected_domain, expected_sources in test_cases:
    classification = router.classify_query(query)
    print(f"Query: {query}")
    print(f"Expected: {expected_domain}, Got: {classification.domain}")
    print(f"Expected sources: {expected_sources}")
    print(f"Got sources: {classification.recommended_sources[:2]}")
```

**Solutions:**
1. **Expand Domain Keywords**: Add more domain-specific terms
