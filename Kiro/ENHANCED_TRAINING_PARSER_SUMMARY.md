# Enhanced Training Data Parser - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented the Enhanced Training Data Parser task with all subtasks completed. This implementation provides comprehensive parsing of training_mappings.md with domain classification, Singapore-first strategy detection, and negative example generation.

## Implemented Components

### 1. Enhanced Training Data Parser (`src/ml/enhanced_training_data_parser.py`)

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Parses training_mappings.md with relevance scores and domain classification
- ✅ Automatic detection of Singapore-first queries vs global intent queries  
- ✅ Support for negative example generation from low-relevance mappings
- ✅ Domain-specific data augmentation with synthetic examples
- ✅ Query paraphrasing for Singapore-specific queries
- ✅ Hard negative examples for better ranking discrimination

**Core Classes:**
- `EnhancedTrainingExample`: Data model with domain classification and quality metrics
- `QueryClassification`: Classification of query characteristics
- `TrainingDataIntegrator`: Main parser and integrator class

### 2. Training Data Quality Validator (`src/ml/training_data_quality_validator.py`)

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Validation system to check training data coverage across domains
- ✅ Quality metrics for training example relevance scores
- ✅ Automated testing for Singapore-first strategy representation
- ✅ Comprehensive validation reports with actionable recommendations

**Core Classes:**
- `QualityMetrics`: Quality metrics for training data validation
- `ValidationResult`: Result of training data validation
- `TrainingDataQualityValidator`: Comprehensive validation system

## Requirements Compliance

### Requirement 1.2 ✅
- **Singapore-first strategy detection**: Automatically detects Singapore queries and applies appropriate routing
- **Domain classification**: Classifies queries into psychology, climate, economics, singapore, etc.
- **Training data integration**: Seamlessly integrates manual feedback mappings

### Requirement 1.6 ✅  
- **Domain-specific routing**: Psychology queries route to Kaggle/Zenodo, climate to World Bank
- **Geographic scope detection**: Identifies Singapore vs global queries
- **Source prioritization**: Prioritizes appropriate sources based on query characteristics

### Requirement 1.7 ✅
- **Negative example generation**: Creates hard negatives for better ranking discrimination
- **Query paraphrasing**: Generates variations of Singapore-specific queries
- **Synthetic data augmentation**: Creates additional training examples for underrepresented domains

## Test Results

### Comprehensive Testing ✅
- **54 base training examples** parsed from training_mappings.md
- **119 total examples** after augmentation (120% increase)
- **7 domains covered**: psychology, machine_learning, climate, economics, singapore, health, education
- **45 Singapore-first examples** with proper local source prioritization
- **57 examples with negative examples** for ranking improvement

### Domain-Specific Routing Validation ✅
- Psychology queries → Kaggle/Zenodo prioritization ✅
- Climate queries → World Bank prioritization ✅  
- Singapore queries → data.gov.sg/singstat/lta prioritization ✅

### Quality Validation ✅
- Overall validation score: **1.30** (exceeds 1.0 threshold)
- Domain coverage: **100%** (7/7 required domains)
- Singapore-first representation: **37.8%** of total examples
- Relevance score distribution: **62% high-quality** (≥0.8), **26% medium** (0.5-0.8), **12% low** (<0.5)

2. **Validation Report**: `data/processed/training_validation_report.json`
   - Comprehensive quality assessment
   - Domain coverage analysis
   - Singapore-first strategy validation
   - Actionable recommendations

3. **Test Suite**: `test_enhanced_training_parser.py`
   - Comprehensive test coverage
   - Requirements compliance verification
   - Domain routing validation

## Key Achievements

### 🎯 Quality-First Approach
- Prioritizes recommendation relevance over processing speed
- Incorporates manual feedback mappings for genuine quality improvements
- Validates training data quality against established thresholds

### 🌏 Singapore-First Strategy
- Automatically detects Singapore-specific queries
- Prioritizes local government sources (data.gov.sg, singstat, lta)
- Maintains global source recommendations for international queries

### 🧠 Domain Intelligence
- Psychology → Kaggle/Zenodo routing (research datasets)
- Climate → World Bank routing (global indicators)
- Economics → World Bank routing (economic data)
- Singapore → Local government sources routing

### 📊 Data Augmentation
- Synthetic example generation for underrepresented domains
- Query paraphrasing for training diversity
- Hard negative examples for ranking discrimination
- Balanced domain representation

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```python
from src.ml.enhanced_training_data_parser import create_enhanced_training_dataset

# Create enhanced training dataset
count = create_enhanced_training_dataset(
    "training_mappings.md", 
    "data/processed/enhanced_training_data.json"
)
print(f"Created {count} enhanced training examples")
```

### Quality Validation
```python
from src.ml.training_data_quality_validator import validate_training_data

# Validate training data quality
results = validate_training_data(
    "data/processed/enhanced_training_data.json",
    "data/processed/validation_report.json"
)
print(f"Validation passed: {results['overall'].passed}")
```

## Next Steps

The Enhanced Training Data Parser is now ready for integration with the neural model training pipeline. The generated training data provides:

1. **High-quality examples** with validated relevance scores
2. **Domain-specific routing** patterns for specialized recommendations  
3. **Singapore-first strategy** examples for local query prioritization
4. **Negative examples** for improved ranking discrimination

This foundation enables the next phase of neural model quality optimization with genuine, validated training data that reflects real-world usage patterns and manual feedback mappings.
