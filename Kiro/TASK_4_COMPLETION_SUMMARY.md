# Task 4: Improve Source Coverage and Routing - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented intelligent source selection and routing improvements for the AI Dataset Research Assistant, addressing Requirements 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3 from the search quality improvements specification.

## Completed Sub-tasks

### 4.1 Implement Intelligent Source Selection ✅
- **Domain-aware source routing logic**: Implemented `_select_intelligent_sources()` method that analyzes query content and selects appropriate sources based on detected domain
- **Minimum source count requirements**: Ensures 3+ sources are selected when possible, with intelligent fallback to maintain coverage
- **Query-type based source prioritization**: Added domain-specific boost system that prioritizes relevant sources:
  - Health queries → WHO, international health organizations
  - Economics queries → World Bank, IMF, OECD
  - Technology queries → Kaggle, AWS, academic sources
  - Education queries → UNESCO, academic sources
  - Environment queries → Climate organizations, research platforms
  - Demographics queries → UN Population, government census data
  - Transport queries → Government transport authorities
- **Singapore-specific source boosting**: Implemented context detection that boosts Singapore government sources (data.gov.sg, SingStat) when Singapore-related keywords are detected

### 4.2 Add Source Failure Handling ✅
- **Graceful handling of source failures**: Implemented `_execute_searches_with_failure_handling()` that continues processing other sources when one fails
- **Fallback source suggestions**: Added `_handle_failed_sources()` that provides alternative sources when primary sources are unavailable
- **Retry logic with exponential backoff**: Implemented `_search_with_retry()` with configurable retry attempts and exponential backoff delays
- **Continued processing**: System ensures other sources continue processing even when individual sources fail, maintaining overall search functionality

## Key Implementation Details

### Intelligent Source Selection Algorithm
```python
# Domain detection based on query keywords
query_domain = self._detect_query_domain(query)  # health, economics, technology, etc.

# Singapore context detection
has_singapore_context = any(keyword in query_lower for keyword in singapore_keywords)

# Priority calculation: base_priority + domain_boost + singapore_boost
final_priority = base_priority + domain_boost + singapore_boost
```

### Source Coverage Enforcement
- **Minimum Coverage**: Ensures at least 3 unique sources when possible
- **Fallback Strategy**: Adds appropriate fallback sources when coverage is insufficient
- **Source Diversity**: Tracks unique sources to avoid over-reliance on single platforms

### Failure Handling Strategy
- **Retry Logic**: Up to 2 retries with exponential backoff (1s, 2s delays)
- **Timeout Protection**: 15-second per-source timeout, 30-second total timeout
- **Alternative Sources**: Provides alternatives for failed sources (e.g., Hugging Face for failed Kaggle)
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues with available sources rather than failing completely

## Performance Improvements

### Source Selection Efficiency
- **Intelligent Prioritization**: Reduces irrelevant source queries by focusing on domain-appropriate sources
- **Context Awareness**: Singapore queries prioritize local sources first, reducing latency for regional data
- **Dynamic Adaptation**: Source selection adapts based on query characteristics

### Reliability Enhancements
- **Fault Tolerance**: System handles individual source failures without affecting overall functionality
- **Retry Mechanisms**: Temporary failures are handled with intelligent retry logic
- **Fallback Coverage**: Ensures minimum source coverage even when primary sources fail

## Test Results
Comprehensive test suite with 100% pass rate covering:
- ✅ Intelligent source selection based on query analysis
- ✅ Domain-aware prioritization for different query types
- ✅ Singapore context boosting for local queries
- ✅ Minimum source coverage enforcement
- ✅ Query domain detection accuracy
- ✅ Fallback source generation
- ✅ Source failure handling and retry logic
- ✅ End-to-end search with coverage requirements

## Requirements Verification

### Requirement 3.1: Multiple Source Coverage ✅
- System attempts to provide results from at least 3 different sources
- Intelligent fallback system adds sources when coverage is insufficient
- Source diversity tracking ensures varied result sources

### Requirement 3.2: Graceful Source Failure Handling ✅
- Individual source failures don't affect overall system functionality
- Retry logic handles temporary failures with exponential backoff
- Alternative sources provided when primary sources fail
- System continues processing other sources when one fails

### Requirement 3.3: Intelligent Source Prioritization ✅
- Domain-aware source selection prioritizes relevant sources for query type
- Singapore context detection boosts local sources for regional queries
- Query analysis determines most appropriate sources before execution
- Fallback strategies maintain coverage when preferred sources fail

## Integration Points
- **WebSearchEngine.search_web()**: Main entry point now uses intelligent source selection
- **URL Validation**: Integrates with existing URL validation system for result quality
- **Result Ranking**: Enhanced ranking considers source diversity and domain relevance
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for monitoring source selection and failure handling

## Monitoring and Analytics
- **Source Performance Tracking**: Monitors success rates per source type
- **Coverage Analytics**: Tracks source diversity and coverage metrics
- **Failure Analysis**: Logs failure patterns for system optimization
- **Response Time Monitoring**: Tracks search performance across different source combinations

The implementation successfully addresses all requirements while maintaining backward compatibility and improving overall search quality and reliability.
