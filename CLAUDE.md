## Legacy Documentation: Original AI Phase Setup and Testing

### Original Implementation Guidance:

I've just implemented the AI phase of my dataset research assistant. Please help me test and verify everything is working correctly. Here's what I need you to do:

### 1. Check File Structure
Please verify all AI files are in the correct locations:
```
config/
  └── ai_config.yml
src/
  └── ai/
      ├── __init__.py
      ├── ai_config_manager.py
      ├── llm_clients.py
      ├── neural_ai_bridge.py
      ├── research_assistant.py
      ├── conversation_manager.py
      ├── evaluation_metrics.py
      ├── api_server.py
      └── vllm_local_client.py (optional)
ai_pipeline.py
test_ai_system.py
requirements_ai.txt
```

### 2. Check Dependencies
Verify all required packages are installed:
```bash
# Check if these are installed
python -c "
import anthropic
import openai
import mistralai
import fastapi
import aiohttp
print('✅ All core dependencies found')
"
```

### 3. Check Environment Variables
Verify the .env file has all API keys:
```bash
# Check .env file
cat .env | grep -E "(MINIMAX|MISTRAL|CLAUDE|OPENAI)_API_KEY"
```

### 4. Run Comprehensive Test
Run the test suite:
```bash
python test_ai_system.py
```

Expected output should show:
- ✅ LLM Connectivity: All providers connected
- ✅ Neural Bridge: Model interface working
- ✅ Research Assistant: Pipeline functional
- ✅ Conversation Manager: Sessions working
- ✅ Evaluation Metrics: Tracking enabled
- ✅ API Server Config: Ready to start

### 5. Test Interactive Mode
Test the interactive CLI:
```bash
python ai_pipeline.py --mode interactive
```

Try these test queries:
1. "housing prices singapore HDB"
2. "help" (to see commands)
3. "metrics" (to see system metrics)
4. "refine:focus on recent 2024 data"
5. "exit"

### 6. Test API Server
Start the API server:
```bash
python ai_pipeline.py --mode api --port 8000
```

In another terminal, test the endpoints:
```bash
# Test health check
curl http://localhost:8000/api/health

# Test search (you'll need to create a proper JSON request)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "transportation data singapore"}'
```

### 7. Check for Common Issues

**Issue 1: ModuleNotFoundError**
- Solution: Install missing module with pip

**Issue 2: API Key errors**
- Solution: Check .env file has correct keys

**Issue 3: Neural model not found**
- Solution: Ensure DL pipeline was run first

**Issue 4: Port already in use**
- Solution: Change port or kill existing process

### 8. Performance Check
When testing queries, verify:
- Response time < 3 seconds
- All 4 LLM providers are accessible
- Recommendations have explanations
- Confidence scores are present

### 9. Create Summary Report
Please provide a summary:
1. Which components are working ✅
2. Which have issues ❌
3. Performance metrics observed
4. Any error messages encountered
5. Recommendations for fixes

### 10. Production Deployment Testing
Test the organized production deployment system:
```bash
# Test production readiness
python src/deployment/start_production.py --check-only

# Start production server with optimizations
python src/deployment/start_production.py

# Alternative: Use simple launcher from project root
python deploy.py

# Test health and performance
curl http://localhost:8000/api/health
curl http://localhost:8000/api/metrics
```

Expected deployment features:
- ✅ 84% Response Time Improvement (30s → 4.75s)
- ✅ Multi-Modal Search Engine (0.24s response time)
- ✅ Intelligent Caching (66.67% hit rate)
- ✅ Comprehensive Health Monitoring
- ✅ Organized deployment structure in `src/deployment/`
- ✅ Production documentation in `src/deployment/README_deployment.md`

### 11. Optional: Test vLLM Setup
Only if user wants local inference:
```python
# Check if GPU is available
import torch
print(f"GPU Available: {torch.cuda.is_available()}")
print(f"GPU Name: {torch.cuda.get_device_name(0) if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'None'}")

# Check vLLM installation
try:
    import vllm
    print("✅ vLLM installed")
except ImportError:
    print("❌ vLLM not installed (only needed for local models)")
```

### Key Questions to Answer:
1. Are all API endpoints responding?
2. Is the neural model bridge loading correctly?
3. Are responses being generated in under 5 seconds with optimizations?
4. Is the fallback mechanism working if a provider fails?
5. Are explanations being generated for recommendations?
6. Is the production deployment system working correctly?
7. Are performance optimizations achieving target improvements?

Please run through these tests and provide a comprehensive report on the AI system's status.

- `phase_2_analysis` - Keyword weights, relationship thresholds, user behavior settings
- `phase_3_reporting` - Visualization settings, quality thresholds
- `pipeline` - ML readiness criteria, logging, monitoring

### ML Configuration
ML-specific settings in `config/ml_config.yml`:
- Model configurations (TF-IDF, Semantic, Hybrid)
- Training parameters and hyperparameter grids
- Evaluation metrics and thresholds

## ML Readiness Assessment

The pipeline evaluates ML readiness using configurable thresholds:
```yaml
ml_readiness_thresholds:
  min_total_datasets: 15
  min_high_quality_datasets: 10
  min_ground_truth_scenarios: 3
  min_high_confidence_scenarios: 2
  min_relationship_pairs: 5
```

Expected performance based on ground truth quality:
- 5+ high-confidence scenarios: F1@3 = 0.75-0.85
- 3+ high-confidence scenarios: F1@3 = 0.70-0.80
- 2+ high-confidence scenarios: F1@3 = 0.60-0.70

## Important Implementation Notes

### User Behavior Integration
The system analyzes user interaction patterns from `data/raw/user_behaviour.csv` to:
- Segment users (power users, casual users, quick browsers)
- Inform ground truth scenario generation
- Validate relationship discoveries

### Quality Scoring System
Automated quality assessment (0.0-1.0 scale) based on:
- Title Quality (20%)
- Description Quality (30%) 
- Metadata Completeness (25%)
- Source Credibility (25%)

### Production-Ready Features
- Comprehensive error handling and retry logic
- Rate limiting for API compliance
- Robust logging and monitoring
- Memory-efficient processing for large datasets
- Cross-validation and hyperparameter optimization for ML models

## Development Workflow

1. Modify configurations in `config/` files rather than hardcoding
2. Test individual phases before full pipeline runs
3. Use `--validate-only` flag to check environment setup
4. Monitor logs in `logs/` directory for debugging
5. Review outputs in `outputs/EDA/reports/` for insights

## Performance Optimization

For large datasets, adjust configuration:
```yaml
phase_1_extraction:
  timeout_seconds: 60
  retry_attempts: 5
phase_2_analysis:
  max_relationships_per_dataset: 20
phase_3_reporting:
  visualizations:
    dpi: 200  # Lower resolution for faster generation
```

## ML Performance Troubleshooting

### Low F1@3 Performance (< 30%)

**Symptoms**: ML pipeline shows F1@3 scores below 30% instead of expected >70%

**Root Causes Identified**:
1. **Ground truth quality** - scenarios too broad/generic
2. **Text processing** - artificial repetition skewing similarity
3. **Query-dataset mismatch** - exact titles vs semantic queries  
4. **Similarity thresholds** - too restrictive filtering

**Solutions Applied**:
1. **Enhanced ground truth generation** (`src/data/02_analysis_module.py`):
   - Semantic clustering by topic instead of exact title matching
   - Cross-domain scenarios with meaningful semantic queries
   - Improved query generation with semantic mappings

2. **Optimized text preprocessing** (`src/ml/ml_preprocessing.py`):
   - Semantic enhancement without artificial repetition
   - Abbreviation expansion and context addition
   - Domain-specific semantic mappings

3. **Improved similarity thresholds** (`src/ml/model_training.py`):
   - Percentile-based thresholds instead of std-based
   - Much more permissive filtering (70th percentile)
   - Fallback to top-k regardless of threshold

4. **Enhanced query preprocessing**:
   - Consistent abbreviation expansion
   - Semantic context addition for common patterns
   - Better normalization for cross-model consistency

**Expected Performance**: >70% F1@3 after applying these fixes

### Re-running After Fixes

```bash
# Clear existing models and ground truth
rm -rf models/* data/processed/intelligent_ground_truth.json

# Regenerate enhanced ground truth  
python data_pipeline.py --phase 2

# Retrain ML models with new preprocessing
python ml_pipeline.py

# Expected results: F1@3 > 70% for semantic and hybrid models
```
